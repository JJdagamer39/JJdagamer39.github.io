            <h1>A Park of Peace and Nice Views</h1>
            <p> My dad would often take me on walks to many parks ever since I was young. Sometimes I would enjoy it since I was gaining fresh air and getting the exercise I needed, but oftentimes I would get bored and find it irritating that we were going to the same neighborhood park just because it was not that far from my house. That park we would go to wasn’t even that interesting, and it didn’t even have the right environment or enough variety to help me do what I pleased. I had to deal with the same routine every 2 weeks and let me tell you how provoking it was just walking around only seeing trees everywhere along with kids yelling and playing at the playground. At this point, I would come to the same park every time feeling like there was no point in being there and that this was a complete waste of my time. After years passed, my dad decided that he and I should explore new parks. He then concluded that we should try this interesting park at Hunters Point in Long Island City.</p>
            <p>My mind was blown away once we got there. I felt amazed at how unique this whole park was compared to the other parks I’ve been to. All these other parks were just playgrounds for little kids to enjoy and trees for people to gaze at. Not to mention the amount of space that those other parks had were very small and just didn’t have enough space for people to do what they wanted to do alone. I was getting some type of chaotic vibe every time I would come to those parks that were only just a playground with a square-shaped space. However, this adventurous park had a variety of activities for people to do what they pleased. Hunter’s Point South Park had unlimited space, had a river that cuts in between Manhattan and Queens, and also had a Dog Park because let’s be honest, who doesn’t like dogs? I also get a calm and relaxing vibe every time I would step foot in that park. Sure there are other parks in Queens that have unique environments, but this one contained a very peaceful environment for people to relax, for people to take walks, and most importantly for people to have a glorious view of the east side of Manhattan, especially at night.</p>
            <p>I always enjoyed taking pictures of the beautiful sites that New York holds, so seeing a nice view of Manhattan was the perfect treat for me to take a clean photo of the view I was gazing at. The view gets better once night falls and the buildings begin to light up making the whole city glow at night. When it comes to looking at the view of Hunter’s Point South Park, I honestly get future vibes on what Manhattan would look like if 100 years were to pass by along with a sign of completing a full week of school. They may be future thoughts, but my thoughts and predictions could happen. Hunter's Point South Park is a perfect place to film a video since it’s mostly peaceful and doesn’t have too much noise other than the waves rocking back and forth when it’s windy. Back in my middle school days, one of my friends wanted me to go to Hunters Point South Park with him to help him film a video he was making so that he can have the view of Manhattan as the background. So we ended up using the circle part of the park to film the battle scene he wanted. Mind you, it took an hour to get the scene right, but it worked out in the end. </p>
            <p>As I got older, I started seeing Hunter’s Point South Park as a perfect place to relax and reflect on how far I’ve come. Often I would be just sitting on the benches that were close to the river and as I would be doing that I would be gathering my thoughts and concluding on if what I’m doing in life is either the right path for me or the wrong path. The sound of the waves rocking and wind giving a small breeze puts you connected towards nature and a quiet place that would help support your reflection process. A whole park is a good place for people to often meditate and just gather their thoughts on what’s on their mind most of the time. I would often go to Hunter’s Point South Park about every 3 weeks if it’s a good day to just gather my thoughts on what’s been on my mind all day along with deciding what I should do better moving forward.</p>
